# hello-world
Learning Repository.
I am learning Github. 
I am not aspiring to be a programmer, but
I don't want to sit like a dumb person when I am in the middle of technical folks.
Trying to update README again so that I can commit, pull and merge again. 

I also would like to learn python again. Use it for integrating my code using Github Actions.
This will help me understand CI/CD.
The world has changed and I am still in 1990s !!
